# Introduction to Pipelines and Workflows in the Armonik Repository

The Armonik repositories are a collaborative development space where our team works by sharing code, practice, conventions and discussions around the project. At the heart of this development process are pipelines and workflows, which are an essential elements in the working methodology choosed by the developers. 
These workflows are helping the developers by providing some help in the development process to avoid, as much as possible, regressions but also are helping them to follow the processes chooses by the project.

## Similar Workflows for Efficient Management

One of the key features of our Armonik repository is the use of similar workflows for different components of the project. These workflows, while tailored to the specific needs of each component, follow a common basic structure. This consistent approach makes it easier to understand, maintain, and collaborate within our team.

Our standardized workflows include:

- **Work in Progress (WIP)**: This workflow focuses on ongoing contributions, allowing developers to collaborate on features and bug fixes. Code validations, automated tests, and code reviews are integral parts of this process.

- **Automated Testing**: A dedicated workflow for automated testing is triggered whenever a new contribution is submitted. This ensures that our code adheres to quality standards and functions correctly.
