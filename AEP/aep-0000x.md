# Abstract

This AEP proposes a new architecture for ArmoniK's extension, aiming to create a standard for extensions development and bring users closer to the core paradigms of ArmoniK. The proposed extension is designed to enhance user interaction, enabling more intuitive and direct integration with ArmoniK.

# Motivation

This AEP aims to create a standard architecture for ArmoniK's extension development. It proposes services decoupling, segregating interfaces to related domains, and enriching domains.

The proposed architecture will:
- Define a clear architecture for development.
- Introduce a modular design to ensure extensions can be developed and tested.
- Enhance the user interface to make the integration process more intuitive.

# Specification

## Domain Segregation

To improve clarity and structure, the ArmoniK SDK will keep domain segregation to ensure modularity and ease of use. These domains will encapsulate related services and functionalities, promoting a separation of concerns and enhancing maintainability and scalability:

- **Task Domain**: Manages tasks, offering functionalities for task submission and monitoring. A task is an atomic computation taking one or several input data and producing one or several outputs. Tasks are process that execute on 

- **Data Domain**: Manages data entities, inputs and outputs of a Task execution. This domain provides services for creating, uploading, and downloading data results.

- **Session Domain**: A session is a logical container for tasks and associated data (task statut, results, errors, etc). Responsible for managing sessions and their related operations.  

- **Observer Domain**: 

## Handlers

To enrich the behavior within each domain, we introduce the concept of handlers. Handlers enable domains to contain their own specialized behaviors and functionalities. For instance, a `TaskHandler` might offer a extension method to get detailed state information of the task.

## Services

Each domain will contain specific services to encapsulate its functionalities:

- **Session Domain**:
  - **SessionService (`ISessionService`)**: Manages sessions and provides an interface for session-related operations.

- **Data Management Domain**:
  - **ResultsService (`IResultsService`)**: Handles results and metadata (inputs and outputs), representing data entities within ArmoniK. It offers methods for creating, uploading, and downloading results.

- **Task Management Domain**:
  - **TasksService (`ITasksService`)**: Manages tasks, offering functionalities for submitting and monitoring tasks.

## ArmoniKClient

Interaction with ArmoniK will be managed through the `ArmoniKClient`, which oversees all services and channel pools. `ArmoniKClient` exposes functions that allow users to access these services, promoting a cohesive and intuitive user experience:

- **`GetSessionService()`**: Retrieves the service responsible for session management.
- **`GetResultsService()`**: Provides the service for managing data results.
- **`GetTasksService()`**: Accesses the service for task management.
