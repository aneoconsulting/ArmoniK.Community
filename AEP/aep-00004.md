## Abstract

This AEP introduces a new C# extension for ArmoniK, aiming to bring users closer to the core paradigms of ArmoniK. The proposed extension is designed to enhance user interaction, enabling more intuitive and direct integration with ArmoniK services.

## Motivation

Initially, the C# extension was developed as three separate SDKs, each mirroring the functionalities of Symphony's and Data Synapse's SDKs, followed by a unified extension. Despite offering user interaction interfaces, the extension is significantly limited in functionality, especially concerning data and task management strategies. Design limitations not only hinder the extensionâ€™s evolution but also underutilize the potential of C#'s language features. Additionally, restrictive design constrains testing capabilities, making sustainable evolution of the extension challenging. This AEP seeks to address these issues by proposing a redesigned C# extension to improve code maintainability and optimize the use of ArmoniK's functionalities.

## Specification

### Services

To improve clarity and structure, the ArmoniK SDK will feature multiple services, each responsible for specific aspects of the API to ensure modularity and ease of use:

- **SessionService (`ISessionService`)**: Manages sessions and provides an interface for session-related operations.
- **BlobService (`IBlobService`)**: Handles Results and ResultMetadatas (Inputs and Outputs), representing data entities within ArmoniK. It offers methods for creating, uploading, and downloading results.
- **TasksService (`ITasksService`)**: Manages tasks, offering functionalities for submitting and monitoring tasks.
- **EventsService (`IEventsService`)**: Manages events within the ArmoniK ecosystem, facilitating real-time notifications and responses to various operational events.

### ArmoniKClient

Interaction with ArmoniK will be managed through the ArmoniKClient, which oversees all services and channel pools. ArmoniKClient exposes functions that allow users to access these services:

- **`Task<ISessionService> GetSessionService()`**: Retrieves the service responsible for session management.
- **`Task<IBlobService> GetBlobService(Session session)`**: Provides the service for managing data results.
- **`Task<ITasksService> GetTasksService(Session session)`**: Accesses the service for task management.
- **`Task<IEventsService> GetEventsService(Session session)`**: Obtains the service for event management.
- **ObserverService**: Deals with the EventsApi to monitor the lifecycle of sessions, tasks, and results.
